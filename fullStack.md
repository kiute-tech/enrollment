# Full-time  

### General

Our interviews try to simulate the work you'd do on a day-to-day basis.

We will not ask for deep algorithm questions, no projects in Kiute required to implement complex binary search tree from scratch.

We are also perfectly fine with people that are googling or asking help of their interviewers.

Programming part has to be written in `Typescript` `Javascript`.
all lib / framework is allowed.


### Design - implementation (80 - 120 min) 

You have to design and implement API or Web interface for a technical / user end to end problem.
We will try to ask question tailor your fields of expertise, then produce a prototype.
Again, we are asking for a prototype of the solution, we will observe how you solve an end to end problem, but it has to be built as the code goes into production : code quality, write tests and so on.
This is **ok** if this is not finish.


### Raw Programming (45 min - 60 min)

This is a small exercise, it has to be written in pure code, no lib, no framework.
We will see how you can produce code when the restriction are limpid.
As always, code should be clear and maintainable.


### Bug squash (40 - 60 min)

We take a popular random repo on github and you have to fix a bug.
We will observe how you manage a non-familiar codebase, and how you fix other people's code.


### Refactoring (30 - 45 min)

We will give you a small project that need refactoring, and you have to improve it. The goal is to see what is _good code_ for you.



During the assessment, we will pay attention about how it could be to work with you, mostly we are looking for enjoyable communication.
